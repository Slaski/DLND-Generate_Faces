# Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation

## Project 5 - Generate Faces

This is the fifth project from the Deep Learning Nanodegree from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). In this project we have to train a Generative Adversarial Network to generate images from the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and the [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html).

## Dependencies

* numpy
* jupyter notebook
* tensorflow

Install missing dependencies with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) and/or [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Tensorflow can be installed via this [link](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).

## Usage

Once dependencies are installed, just run `jupyter notebook` in the terminal to see the code.
